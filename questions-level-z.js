            { id: 4524, storyId: 288, category: "inference", type: "multiple", question: "Why might the passage's question about whether sport determines 'natural human limits' versus 'maximum performance through any means' be so significant?", options: ["It's a trivial distinction with no real implications", "The answer determines whether we view sport as celebrating human capability or simply pursuing the highest possible performance, which shapes rules about enhancement", "Everyone already agrees on the answer", "The question only applies to professional athletes"], correct: 1, hint: "If sport is about natural limits, enhancement is cheating; if it's about maximum performance, enhancement is progress.", explanation: "This question is fundamental because the answer determines whether technological/genetic enhancement represents an extension of athletic achievement or a fundamental corruption of sport's purpose!" },

            { id: 4533, storyId: 288, category: "text_structure", type: "multiple", question: "How is 'The Future of Sports' organized?", options: ["By examining three categories of transformation (physical technology, genetics, virtual reality), then raising the fundamental values questions they collectively pose", "As a chronological history of sports technology", "As a rule book for future sports competitions", "As a comparison between specific sports"], correct: 0, hint: "Notice how each technology section leads to the final questions about athletic values.", explanation: "The passage examines three technological frontiers in sequence, then converges on the fundamental values questions that all three collectively raise about sport's future purpose!" },
