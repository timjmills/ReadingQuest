            { id: 4535, storyId: 289, category: "theme", type: "multiple", question: "What is the central theme of 'Democratic Backsliding'?", options: ["Democracy is guaranteed to last forever once established", "Democratic erosion happens gradually and insidiously within democratic structures, making it difficult to identify and resist until institutions have been fundamentally weakened", "Only authoritarian countries experience political problems", "Democratic backsliding only affects small, poor countries"], correct: 1, hint: "Think about why the passage says backsliding mechanisms are 'insidious precisely because they occur incrementally.'", explanation: "The passage argues that democracy's greatest threat comes not from coups but from gradual, incremental erosion by elected leaders who use democratic processes to undermine democratic substance!" },
            { id: 4536, storyId: 289, category: "inference", type: "multiple", question: "Why is it significant that leaders causing democratic backsliding are 'democratically elected'?", options: ["It proves democracy is working perfectly", "It means the erosion comes from within the system rather than from external threats, making it harder to identify as antidemocratic", "Elected leaders can never threaten democracy", "It's not significant at all"], correct: 1, hint: "If the threat comes from elected leaders using legitimate power, how do you distinguish it from normal governance?", explanation: "When elected leaders use democratic authority to erode democracy, each individual step appears legitimate--making it nearly impossible to draw a clear line between governing and undermining!" },
            { id: 4537, storyId: 289, category: "vocabulary", type: "multiple", question: "What does 'insidious' mean when the passage says backsliding mechanisms are 'insidious precisely because they occur incrementally'?", options: ["Obvious, transparent, and easy to detect", "Operating in a subtle, harmful way that is difficult to notice until damage is done", "Beneficial and helpful to democratic institutions", "Happening all at once in a dramatic way"], correct: 1, hint: "The harm is hard to see because it happens gradually within normal structures.", explanation: "'Insidious' means proceeding harmfully but subtly--democratic backsliding is insidious because each step seems small and justifiable while collectively transforming the system!" },
            { id: 4538, storyId: 289, category: "sequence", type: "multiple", question: "According to the passage, what is the typical sequence of democratic backsliding?", options: ["Leaders are elected, then use their positions to change electoral rules, control media, constrain opposition, and appoint partisan judges--each step individually justifiable but collectively transformative", "A military coup overthrows the government overnight", "Opposition parties voluntarily surrender power", "International organizations impose authoritarian rules"], correct: 0, hint: "The passage describes a gradual process where 'each step is individually justifiable.'", explanation: "Backsliding follows a pattern: democratic election, then tilting future competitions through rule changes, media control, opposition constraints, and judicial appointments--incremental steps that collectively destroy democracy!" },
            { id: 4539, storyId: 289, category: "character", type: "multiple", question: "What does the passage say about why some democracies prove resilient while others erode?", options: ["The reasons are fully understood and predictable", "The same risk factors exist in resilient and eroding democracies, so context-specific analysis is needed to understand why outcomes differ", "Only wealthy democracies are resilient", "Only old democracies face backsliding risks"], correct: 1, hint: "The passage says risk factors 'exist in societies that haven't backslid.'", explanation: "The passage notes that economic insecurity, social media, and institutional weaknesses exist even in resilient democracies--making context-specific analysis essential to understanding different outcomes!" },
            { id: 4540, storyId: 289, category: "main_idea", type: "multiple", question: "What is the main idea of 'Democratic Backsliding'?", options: ["Democratic erosion has become a global phenomenon where elected leaders gradually undermine democratic institutions from within, with causes that are understood but outcomes that remain uncertain", "Democracy is thriving everywhere in the world", "Only non-Western countries experience democratic problems", "Democratic backsliding is easily reversed once identified"], correct: 0, hint: "What does the passage argue about the scope, mechanism, causes, and uncertain future of democratic backsliding?", explanation: "The passage presents democratic backsliding as a global phenomenon characterized by incremental internal erosion, driven by identifiable factors, with genuinely uncertain prospects for reversal!" },
            { id: 4541, storyId: 289, category: "cause_effect", type: "multiple", question: "According to the passage, what conditions create populations 'receptive to strongman appeals'?", options: ["Prosperity and social harmony", "Economic insecurity and cultural anxiety", "High levels of education and media literacy", "Strong democratic institutions and traditions"], correct: 1, hint: "The passage identifies what makes populations vulnerable to authoritarian leaders.", explanation: "The passage identifies 'economic insecurity and cultural anxiety' as conditions that create receptivity to strongman leaders who promise simple solutions to complex problems!" },
            { id: 4542, storyId: 289, category: "compare_contrast", type: "multiple", question: "How does the passage contrast the post-Cold War optimism about democracy with the current reality?", options: ["Both periods show identical trends", "After the Cold War, democracy appeared to be 'history's inevitable direction,' but now 'democratic backsliding has become a global phenomenon' affecting established democracies too", "The current period is more optimistic than the post-Cold War era", "The passage doesn't compare these periods"], correct: 1, hint: "Compare 'democracy appeared to be history's inevitable direction' with 'that optimism now appears premature.'", explanation: "The passage starkly contrasts post-Cold War optimism about democracy's inevitable triumph with the current reality of global democratic erosion--even in previously stable democracies!" },
            { id: 4543, storyId: 289, category: "fact_opinion", type: "multiple", question: "Which of the following from the passage is a verifiable FACT?", options: ["Democracy will inevitably decline everywhere", "All populist leaders are equally dangerous to democracy", "Hungary and Poland have seen ruling parties systematically undermine judicial independence, press freedom, and electoral fairness", "Democratic backsliding will definitely be reversed within a decade"], correct: 2, hint: "Which statement describes specific, documented political developments?", explanation: "The undermining of judicial independence, press freedom, and electoral fairness in Hungary and Poland are documented political developments that can be verified!" },
            { id: 4544, storyId: 289, category: "author_purpose", type: "multiple", question: "Why does the author emphasize that each step of backsliding is 'individually justifiable'?", options: ["To praise the leaders who take these steps", "To explain why democratic backsliding is so difficult to resist--each individual action appears legitimate, making it hard to identify the collectively antidemocratic pattern", "To argue that these steps are actually beneficial", "To suggest that democratic norms don't matter"], correct: 1, hint: "If each step seems reasonable on its own, when do you sound the alarm?", explanation: "By emphasizing individual justifiability, the author explains backsliding's insidious power--opponents can't point to a single illegitimate act, only to a pattern whose collective effect is antidemocratic!" },
            { id: 4545, storyId: 289, category: "text_structure", type: "multiple", question: "How is 'Democratic Backsliding' organized?", options: ["By contrasting post-Cold War optimism with current reality, describing the mechanisms of backsliding, analyzing its causes, and examining implications for global order", "As a biography of a specific world leader", "As a chronological history of every democracy ever established", "As a debate between two political scientists"], correct: 0, hint: "Notice the progression from historical context to mechanisms to causes to implications.", explanation: "The passage builds from the collapse of post-Cold War democratic optimism, through the mechanisms of gradual erosion, analysis of enabling conditions, and broader implications for international democratic order!" },
